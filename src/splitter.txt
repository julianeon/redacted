Gonsa originally intended to complete the purchase at a show on April 1, 2006.

He told Agent Tunney in a recorded telephone call that he had to change this to April 2 because his bank could not complete the money transfer in time and he had to travel to San Diego to pick up the money for the purchase.

Similar to Gonsaâ€™s March 18 purchase, Agent Tunney planned to conduct surveillance of the April 2 purchase.

The plan also included coordinating with agents Rais and Murdock in the San Diego Office if Gonsa traveled there to pick up the money and placing a tracking device on his vehicle to help locate the machine conversion shop previously mentioned.
